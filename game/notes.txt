    2a: make a class system using 1 of the following methods {
        A. Make a class Class and which will be used in each Player instance (methods would call self.Class.<...>)
        B. Add a string 'class' as an init perameter and use that in Player methods accordingly. 
        C. A character class is a kind of player. Therefore use inheritance (class will inherit from player)
